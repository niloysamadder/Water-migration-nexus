# Water-Migration Nexus
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

• To identify the interactions between the water stress, development status, population density, GDP per capita, national rainfall index, and total population with access to safe drinking water in origin countries and how these interactions influence the international out-migration and in-migration.

• To explore the similarities and differences between the origin and destination countries in water stress-related international migration and what are the policy relevance of these findings.

This project includes the following tasks:
1. Data Visualization: Visualizing and comparing the number of emigrants, number of immigrants, and international migrant stock as a percentage of total population based on the level of water stress and development status of migrant origin and destination countries
2. Data Analysis: Correlation Analysis, Variance Inflation Factor, Descriptive Statistics, Two-Way ANOVA, Post-hoc Analysis
3. Panel Data Regression: Ordinary Least Square Model (OLS), Fixed Effects Model (within), Random Effects Model (random), Langrage Multiplier Test, F Test for Fixed Effects, Hausmann Test
